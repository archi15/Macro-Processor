# Macro-Processor
I have made this Program using C++ language.<br>
A Macro instruction is the notational convenience for the programmer. For every occurrence of macro the whole macro body or macro block of statements gets expanded in the main source code. Thus Macro instructions make writing code more convenient. 

Salient features of Macro Processor: 

* Macro represents a group of commonly used statements in the source programming language.
* Macro Processor replaces each macro instruction with the corresponding group of source language statements. This is known as the expansion of macros.
* Using Macro instructions programmer can leave the mechanical details to be handled by the macro processor.
* Macro Processor designs are not directly related to the computer architecture on which it runs.
* Macro Processor involves definition, invocation, and expansion.
